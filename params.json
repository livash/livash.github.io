It mimics key functionalities of Yahoo's Flickr.com and it is hosted on heroku (flickr-light.herokuapp.com). My Flicker-Light app can support multiple users, who can upload and view uploaded photos, tag photos, leave comments on the photo, and change photo's description, as well as organize photos into albums and galleries to shear with other users. I use Amazon's S3 cloud storage to store user's media files. In contrast to the original Flickr, my Flicker light has some interesting CSS3 animations and styling. I also made a heavy use of JavaScript and jQuery.ui to make  the app mode interactive and dynamic.\r\n\r\n### Databases:\r\n##### Postgres, mySQL, SQLite3, \r\n\r\n### Scientific programming\r\n##### C++, Matlab, Java, Origin, Python\r\n\r\n## Work Experience\r\n##### 09/2011 - 08/2012  Postdoctoral Research Assistant, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM.\r\n##### 06/2010 - 05/2011  Lead Translator, Medical Center BioDar Plus, Donetsk, Ukraine.\r\n##### 01/2007 - 06/2010  Research Associate, Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, MO.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
